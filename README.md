# FirstGame
This is my first game on C++, using SFML. This is a small arena with waves of mobs.

The player can move around the entire arena, kill various mobs and increase his score.
There are several types of mobs: ghosts - the weakest mob (10 points), the headless horseman (20 points),
the king of mobs (40 points) and the king of hell (100 points). All mobs have their own unique icons and characteristics.
Mobs appear in waves, after each reflected wave, mobs bypass the obstacles that are on the map and chase the player using the A* algorithm.
The player has the opportunity to upgrade the character,increase their characteristics, change the sprite. The game has a simple menu,
the game is written in C++ using the SFML library.
